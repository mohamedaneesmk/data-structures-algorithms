Abstract Data Types (ADT)
Abstract Data Types are a step ahead of User-Defined Data Types. The operations are defined, but the implementation is hidden from the user.

Think of an ADT as a conceptual model or interface that specifies:

The type of data stored.
The valid operations on that data.
But not how those operations are implemented.
Example: Stack (an ADT)

A Stack stores elements in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.

Typical operations:

push() – Add an element.
pop() – Remove the top element.
isEmpty() – Check if the stack is empty.
isFull() – Check if the stack is full (in array-based implementation).
The key idea is:
Whether the Stack is implemented using an array or a linked list is hidden from the user.



Why Use ADTs?
Abstraction: The implementation details (like using arrays or linked lists) are hidden from the user.
Flexibility: You can change the internal implementation (e.g., switch from an array to a linked list) without changing how other parts of the program use the ADT.
Modularity: Each ADT can be built, tested, and improved independently.
Maintainability: Easier to manage and update code, since the interface remains consistent.
